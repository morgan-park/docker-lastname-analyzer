# Lastname Analyzer

This web application has been developed with a Flask backend, which incorporates a deep learning model predicting ethnicity based on a user's input--specifically, a last name. It also includes a React frontend. Docker was employed to orchestrate two distinct containers for the backend and frontend, respectively.
